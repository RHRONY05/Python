# Python OS Module Project Ideas

## 1. File Organizer Tool
### Objective:
Create a program that automatically organizes files in a directory based on their file types (e.g., `.txt` files go into a `TextFiles` folder, `.jpg` files go into an `Images` folder).

### Features:
- List files and directories.
- Create directories for different file types.
- Move files into the corresponding folders.

---

## 2. Directory Tree Visualizer
### Objective:
Create a program that prints the directory structure of a folder in a tree-like format.

### Features:
- Traverse directories recursively.
- Print the folder structure with indentation to represent hierarchy.

---

## 3. Duplicate File Finder
### Objective:
Create a tool to find duplicate files in a given directory by comparing their contents or file size.

### Features:
- Compare file size and hash (e.g., MD5 or SHA1).
- Identify duplicate files and display their paths.

---

## 4. Batch File Renaming
### Objective:
Create a program that renames multiple files in a directory based on a pattern (e.g., adding a prefix or suffix).

### Features:
- Rename files in bulk.
- Allow user-defined patterns for renaming (e.g., adding a timestamp, prefix, or suffix).

---

## 5. Log File Cleaner
### Objective:
Create a program that clears the contents of log files that are older than a certain date or exceed a specified size limit.

### Features:
- Check file modification time using `os.path.getmtime()`.
- Clean or archive log files based on age or size.

---

## 6. System Backup Tool
### Objective:
Create a backup tool that copies files and directories from one location to another to create backups.

### Features:
- Copy files from source to backup directory.
- Timestamp backups for versioning.
- Optionally compress files before backing up.

---

## 7. File Permissions Manager
### Objective:
Create a program that changes the permissions of files in a directory based on user input.

### Features:
- Change read/write/execute permissions for files and directories.
- Allow user-defined permission modes (e.g., `0o755`).
